0. Yes ! I hate this `<` and `>`, so html is not my thing.

1. Yes ! Sometimes you need to understand 53 other things at first so to get a better (new)understanding of an idea, that is why the education system have different levels.

2. Yes ! I forget things, that's why I need notes. I will gradually move my notes from google drive to here.

3. Yes ! I'm insterested in what you are seeing. It's about `Mahine Learning ` and it's unpleasant relative `Computational Intelligence`.
    - More data
    - More computing power    
  None of these or their combination would have anything to do with our understanding of `Intelligence`.  
  I would rather treat `Intelligence` as a `natural physical phenomena`

### YYA network and TNNB coding, a demo of computational principles of learning ability.

Three keys:

 - monomorphism --> information preserve, and it obeys the following constrain:

 - local vs global --> layer structure, sparsity coding.

 - learning principle --> variance reduction
