Back propagation is being know as pass the gradient of a network
Belief propagation is ... ok something else.

##1. Back propagation

 $(W,x) \rightarrow y$

 $y = y (W,x | W)$

 I would like to use the notation ' $|$ ' instead of ' $;$ ', to remind myself that $W$ as a parameter of the model/ our hypothesis of the observation, it also contains some background knowledge of our hypothesis together with ' $y$ '.

 ' $y$ ' and ' $W$ ' both our hypothesis of the observation, therefore I use the notation ' $|$ ' instead of ' $;$ '.





##2. Belief propagation
TO DO when want to do
