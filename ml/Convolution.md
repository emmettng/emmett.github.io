# Convolution

## Rant
It has been almost 30 years, what are you guys waiting for?

They collectively contribute to something, something most people have not idea where it would lead to .

In 1989
LeCun
Being mentioned in (deeplearningbook)[www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html], it was 1989 (LeCun)[http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf] bottom of page 544.

## What is it good for?

Intuitive interpretation

composition probolem

what's the point ?

## affine transformation

## convolution

## deconvolution
we assume the input the a result of down-sample of the output, and now we would like to retrive output (doing up-sampling) ...

## Intuitively & Computationally 

persumablelly we will not only being able to increase the dimensionallity but also bring sparsity in the representation .
## details

## **Others**

Images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data have an intrinsic structure. More formally, they share these important properties

Channel â‡’ different viewpoint ?
One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).
